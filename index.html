# COMP 4420/5420 Natural Language Processing - UMass Lowell Spring 2022

## Course Description:

Text is everywhere, and the overload of digital information in our century makes automated processing of text an imperative, whether you are searching for information on the web, trying to understand patterns of interaction in social media and digital communities, need to translate news from another language, or wish to evaluate different treatment options for a particular medical condition.  In this course, we will learn the principles and theory behind the contemporary technology, covering the many applications of automatic text processing, from information retrieval to machine translation.  You will have a chance to build a practical system for the application of your choice.  We will emphasize the developing statistical models for various tasks using large collections of texts, with a particular focus on deep learning techniques.
