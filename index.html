# COMP 4420/5420 Natural Language Processing - UMass Lowell Spring 2022

## Course Description:

Text is everywhere, and the overload of digital information in our century makes automated processing of text an imperative, whether you are searching for information on the web, trying to understand patterns of interaction in social media and digital communities, need to translate news from another language, or wish to evaluate different treatment options for a particular medical condition.  In this course, we will learn the principles and theory behind the contemporary technology, covering the many applications of automatic text processing, from information retrieval to machine translation.  You will have a chance to build a practical system for the application of your choice.  We will emphasize the developing statistical models for various tasks using large collections of texts, with a particular focus on deep learning techniques.

Pre-requisite: COMP 4220 / COMP 5220 Machine Learning or equivalent (with permission of instructor).

## List of Topics:

* Why to use machine learning for language processing
* Sparse and dense word vector representations
* Logistic regression, fully-connected neural networks
* Text pre-processing, tokenization, subword tokenizers
* Language models
* Attention, transformer networks
* Machine translation, sequence-to-sequence neural networks
* Pre-training for NLP: GPT, BERT
* Text-to-text NLP: T5
* Scaling effects of language models, unsupservised task acquisition
* Tasks / Applications
  * Text classification
  * Machine translation
  * Natural language inference
  * Question answering
  * Summarization

## COVID Safety

* Since some of us have high-risk family members at home, we ask that you wear KN95 masks in class.
* If you do not have a KN95 mask, two masks may be requested [here](https://www.uml.edu/sso/auth/signin?returnUrl=%2Fservice%2FApps%2FEEM%2FCovidSupplies%2FRequest)
* If you have been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID, PLEASE DO NOT COME TO CLASS. 
* To join remotely, please contact us and we will send you a zoom link for you to join the class remotely (also posted on Blackboard).  
Note that it might be difficult to ask questions and participate interactively if you join the class via zoom.

## Grading

|-|-|
| Homeworks & quizzes | 60%
| Research Paper Presentations | 10%
| Final Project | 30%

There will be no final or midterm.  

## Homeworks

* We will have 6-7 homeworks. 
* Homeworks are due at midnight on the day before the next lecture.
* Homeworks will be posted on the course website and linked from the course schedule
* Homeworks must be submitted via Blackboard; you must submit a PDF of your homework and a link to a Github repository with your code.

## Quizzes

* We will have take-home quizzes after every lecture
* Quizzes are due immediately before the next lecture
* Quizzes will be posted on the course website

## Research Paper Presentations

* Each student will be required to present a research paper assigned as readings for the class.  
* More information about the research paper presentations can be found [here](https://text-machine-lab.github.io/nlp_class_2022/paper-presentations.html
).

## Final Projects

* You will have several alternatives for the final project.
* Projects will be done in groups of 2.

## Late Policy:

* Quizzes can not be submitted late.
* Homeworks will be accepted up to 2 (two) days after the original due date.
* Homeworks submitted up to 1 full day late will be graded at a 10% reduction.
* Homeworks submitted up to 2 full days late will be graded at a 20% reduction.
* After 2 days, Homeworks will not be accepted.

## Collaboration Policy:

* Homeworks and quizzes must be done individually. 
* Projects can be done in groups of two. 

For the work submitted by a group, please also include a description of what was done by each group member.

Violating the collaboration policy by copying other people's work, as well as any other instance of cheating, 
including copying solutions from existing sources, carries the following penalties: (1) First violation leads 
to getting zero credit for the submitted assignment (2) Second violation leads to failing the course.
