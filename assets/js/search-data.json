Download conda installer. | wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh . NOTE 1a: if this fails with “wget: command not found” install wget via “sudo apt install wget” (Ubuntu) or “brew install wget” (MacOS). Then try to do step 1 again. . NOTE 1b: alternatively, you can just follow the link above using your browser and download the file this way. . Install miniconda. | bash ~/miniconda.sh . Read and accept all licences. | When asked where to install conda, just press enter to install it in the default directory. | IMPORTANT: Then it will ask you “Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3”. Type “yes” and press enter. | IMPORTANT: Restart your terminal session – open and close your terminal window. | NOTE: If you don’t want conda to start base envorinment in every terminal you open, you can execute conda config --set auto_activate_base false. . Create a new environment nlp_class with python 3.7. | conda create --name nlp_class python=3.7 . NOTE: If you have conda not found error, it might mean you skipped step 5 and now need to add conda to your PATH manually. It it easy to do, here’s a solution. . Activate this environment. | conda activate nlp_class . Install required libraries. | python -m pip install jupyterlab torch transformers datasets scikit-learn . Install a new kernel to a jupyter lab. | python -m ipykernel install --name nlp_class . NOTE: If step 10 fails, ask Vlad for help. . Launch jupyter lab. | jupyter lab . This should open a browser tab with Jupyter Lab running. . On the right, you will see a couple of available notebook enviornments under “Notebook” title. Select “nlp_class” and create a new notebook. . | Make sure all imports work. To do this execute the following code. . | import torch import sklearn import transformers import datasets . If this fails, ask Vlad for help. . Now you should be good to go. If you are wondering why we need conda and environments, you can read this blogpost. .",
